# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The project implements and compares two different approaches: a traditional machine learning model (Logistic Regression/Random Forest) and a Transformer-based model for tabular data.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical business metric for telecom companies. Predicting which customers are likely to churn helps companies take proactive measures to retain them. This project uses customer demographics, account information, and service usage data to predict customer churn.

### üéØ Objective
The main goal is to predict whether a customer will **churn** (i.e., leave the service) based on their demographics, account information, and service usage.

## Futher Details

### Data cleaning
* Converted 'TotalCharges' column which is of object type to float type using pd.to_numeric() with errors parameter set to 'coerce' to parse invalid data to NaN.
* 11 missing values were found in the 'TotalCharges' column and were imputed by the mean() value.
* Data has no duplicates.

### Exploratory data analysis
1. Count plot shows the distribution of the churn rate in the data which showed an imbalance in the data.
![Imbalance Data](https://github.com/PiyushLuitel-07/Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Traditional-ML-Algorithm-vs-Transformer-Based-Models/blob/main/images/churn%20imbalance.png)
2. Categorical features count plot insights:
    * Data is evenly distributed between the two genders; males and females, which might be useful in further analysis.
    * No information added by 'No Internet Service' or 'No Phone Service' and 'No' categories.
    --> **Replacing 'No Internet Service' and 'No Phone Service' entries with 'No'**.

3. Histogram and box plot of continous features implies that:
    * No outliers exists.
    * 'TotalCharges' feature is right skewed.

4. Scatter plot of 'MonthlyCharges' vs. 'TotalCharges' shows a positive correlation between both and also it affects the Churn rate positively.

### Feature encoding 
Several encoding techniques were tested on each categorical feature separately and One-Hot encoding all the categorical features gave the best results.

### Feature scaling
log transformation is very powerful in feature scaling specially with skewed data, hence, np.log1p() is applied on 'MonthlyCharges' and 'TotalCharges' features and with trials it proved giving the best results over MinMaxScaler() and StandaredScaler().

### Feature engineering
Binning 'tenure' feature into 6 ranges:
* 0-12 months --> '0-1 years'
* 12-24 months --> '1-2 years'
* 24-36 months --> '2-3 years'
* 36-48 months --> '3-4 years'
* 48-60 months --> '4-5 years'
* More than 60 months --> 'more than 5 years'

### Data imbalance
Data imbalance affects machine learning models by tending only to predict the majority class and ignoring the minority class, hence, having major misclassification of the minority class in comparison with the majority class. Hence, we use techniques to balance class distribution in the data.

Even that our data here doesn't have severe class imbalance, but handling it shows results improvement.
Using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) library in python that randomly increasing the minority class which is 'yes' in our case.

SMOTE synthetically creates new records of the minority class by randomly selecting one or more of the k-nearest neighbors for each example in the minority class. Here, k= 5 neighbors is used. 

### Data Split
20% of the data were splitted for final testing, stratified by the 'Churn' (target) column.

### ‚úÖ Notes
- **Categorical Features**: `gender`, `Partner`, `Dependents`, `Contract`, etc.
- **Numerical Features**: `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`
- `TotalCharges` might be stored as string due to bad formatting; needs to be converted to numeric.

## Results and Findings

- **Class Imbalance**: Slight imbalance ‚Üí handled using **SMOTE**
- **Gender Distribution**: Equal distribution (Male ‚âà Female)
- **Outliers**: No outliers detected in continuous variables (via boxplots)
- **Correlation**: 
  - `MonthlyCharges` and `TotalCharges` ‚Üí positively correlated.
  - Customers with higher `MonthlyCharges` tend to **churn more**.
- **Tenure Insights**:
  - Churn is **very high during the first year**.
  - Very **low churn** beyond 4 years ‚Üí indicates customer **loyalty increases with tenure**.

## Model 1: Transformer-Based Model (TabTransformer)

###  Architecture Overview
- Utilizes **self-attention layers** to capture dependencies among categorical features.
- Categorical features are **embedded** into dense vectors.
- These embeddings are **processed by Transformer blocks** (multi-head attention + feed-forward layers).
- Outputs are concatenated with normalized numerical features and passed through an MLP head.
- Trained using `Binary Cross-Entropy Loss` with the `Adam` optimizer.

### Performance
| Metric         | Class 0 (No) | Class 1 (Yes) |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Precision      | 0.83        | 0.66          |
| Recall         | 0.91        | 0.50          |
| F1-Score       | 0.87        | 0.57          |

- **Accuracy**: 0.80  
- **Macro F1**: 0.72  
- **Weighted F1**: 0.79  
- **ROC AUC Score**: 0.8156 ‚úÖ

> üîé **Observations**:  
> - **Strong overall accuracy and precision**, especially for class 0 (non-churners).
> - Shows **significant improvement** in recall for churners ( **0.50**).
> - ROC AUC of **0.82** indicates good separation capability.
> - Still underperforms in detecting churners compared to Random Forest.

    max_depth=10,
    max_features='log2',
    min_samples_leaf=2,
    n_estimators=200,
    random_state=0

> üìå Key Insight:
> - **Tenure** is the top predictive feature ‚Äî matches EDA findings.
> - Features like **payment method** and **monthly charges** significantly impact churn probability.

##  Recommendation

While both models perform well, the **Random Forest** model remains the **preferred choice** for churn prediction:

### ‚úî Why Random Forest?
- **Higher recall (0.72) for churners** ‚Äî crucial for preventing revenue loss.
- Balanced performance with interpretability.
- Useful for **feature importance analysis** to inform business strategies.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations for Transformer:
- Better overall accuracy, but still **lags behind in identifying churners** effectively.

> üìù **Final Verdict**:  
> For a churn prediction task, **recall for the positive class (churn)** is most important.  
> **Random Forest** provides a **better trade-off** between recall, interpretability, and real-world utility.
