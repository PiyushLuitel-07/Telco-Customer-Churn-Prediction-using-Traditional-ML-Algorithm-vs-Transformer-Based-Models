    "- **Binary Target Variable**: Churn (Yes/No)\n",
    "- **Class Imbalance**: Slight imbalance → handled using **SMOTE**\n",
    "- **Gender Distribution**: Equal distribution (Male ≈ Female)\n",
    "- **Outliers**: No outliers detected in continuous variables (via boxplots)\n",
    "- **Correlation**: \n",
    "  - `MonthlyCharges` and `TotalCharges` → positively correlated.\n",
    "  - Customers with higher `MonthlyCharges` tend to **churn more**.\n",
    "- **Tenure Insights**:\n",
    "  - Churn is **very high during the first year**.\n",
    "  - Very **low churn** beyond 4 years → indicates customer **loyalty increases with tenure**.\n",

    "While both models perform well, the **Random Forest** model remains the **preferred choice** for churn prediction:\n",

    "### ✔ Why Random Forest?\n",
    "- **Higher recall (0.72) for churners** — crucial for preventing revenue loss.\n",
    "- Balanced performance with interpretability.\n",
    "- Useful for **feature importance analysis** to inform business strategies.\n",

    "- Better overall accuracy, but still **lags behind in identifying churners** effectively.\n",

    "> 📝 **Final Verdict**:  \n",
    "> For a churn prediction task, **recall for the positive class (churn)** is most important.  \n",
    "> **Random Forest** provides a **better trade-off** between recall, interpretability, and real-world utility.\n"
